Internships that set the Bar (Harbor): COA Internships from 1970-2023
================
by Y & J Code Craze 

## Summary

Our data about internships that COA students have completed over the last 50 years comes from information compiled by Jeffry Neuhouser and their work study students. The data was collected by looking over old internship reports and entering information into a spreadsheet. This dataset is still growing as Jeffry continues to go through old documents. The currently expanding nature of the data means that our dataset only contains data from students whose last names begin with the letters A through N, and is limited in data related to certain years (especially 2023-2024).
    
In our first visualisation we explore trends of popular terms for COA students to do their internships across each decade. Summer internships are consistently the most popular choice for students regardless of decade. This is followed by Winter, Fall, and Spring terms, respectively. It should be noted that internship numbers may not vary greatly by decade; due to the growing nature of the dataset we simply have incomplete numerical information. However, this visualisation still shows the proportional change in term preference by decade.

In our second visualisation, our aim was to explore what location type was the most popular for internships, as well as whether there had been any significant changes in location type over the years. We separated the internship location into local (locations on MDI), domestic (within the USA), and international. Domestic Internships have been far more popular than international or local internships. The graph also shows an oscillatory relationship between local and international internships, the popularity of one or the other varying greatly over the years. Something that is very clear however is that there was a drop across all internships many times over the years. We are unable to identify a certain cause for most of these drops due to the limits of our dataset, but we feel that we can reasonably assume the drop in 2020 being due to COVID-19.

Our third visualisation shows the most popular internship sites over the last five decades. The most popular internship site, or organisation, has been Allied Whale with 20 internships. Most of the top 10 internship locations are on MDI. These internships sites include at the two major labs on the island and Acadia National Park. Internships at the YMCA include different YMCAs across Maine. Most of the top 10 consists of COA related internship sites including Great Duck Island Research Center, Summer Field Studies, Beech Hill Farm, and COA itself. Over the past 50 years, the most repeated internships have been on MDI or related to COA. 

COA students have travelled all across the globe to complete their internships! We created two leaflet visualisations to show the distribution of internships across the globe. The first leaflet shows all of the internships in our dataset. The markers are clustered to produce a cleaner map; zooming in reveals the locations of each internship in more detail. The second leaflet visualisation is layered by decade. Toggling the layers on and off will show the change in distribution of  internship locations over time. In each decade COA students have completed internships farther away from campus. Clicking on the markers in either of these visualisations will show information about the internship site, the year, and the location name.
