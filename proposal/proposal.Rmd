## 1. Introduction

Text goes here. Refer to the Markdown Quick Reference: Help -> Markdown Quick Reference. 

## 2. Data

<<<<<<< HEAD
This a small overview of our dataset.

```{r glimpse data}
glimpse(Internship_Data_Untidy, na.rm = TRUE) 

#"na.rm = TRUE" is being used because our raw dataset has a lot of NA rows that we were instructed by our data source (Jeffry Neuhouser) to disregard. The data will be tidied and sorted further into the project
```

## 3. Data analysis plan


```{r}
# Code goes here
```


## 4. Data Ethics Review

The data ethics review section will be introduced in a separate class and is not part of the original proposal deadline.
